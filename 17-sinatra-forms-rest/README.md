# Sinatra Forms and REST

We want to do more with our app!

quick review of what we have
we want the user to be able to do more stuff with our page!
handle params in the url
create html forms
lots of work that html / the browser will do for us:

* package up the data from the form fields, send it to our app!
* sinatra does some unpackaging of the data for us - params hash!

We can handle the params in our app.rb
maybe we want to move the handling of the data into a model!
finally, the M in mvc - pull the logic out of app.rb
(quiz scoring into quiz)
HTML form arrays and hashes // sinatra turns those arrays and hashes into actual arrays and hashes

## MVC

Model
View
Controller
