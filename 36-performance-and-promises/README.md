# JS Promises and Performance

- Explain what a Promise is in Javascript
- Use the `new Promise` syntax to create promise objects
- Use `then`, `catch`, and `finally` to handle what happens after our promises.

## Welcome to Callback Hell

- Deeply nested callbacks
- Hard to reason about

## It gets better, I Promise

- Promises are a way to specify what will happen after a value gets resolved
- Promise object - represents deferred computation
- synchronously specify what you want to happen when the future value 'comes into being'

- chain more behavior with `then` and `catch`
